# What I want:

I want to decorate the calendar dinamically with the metrics dor sleeping-quality or tiredness-feeling. I have the values in the state and properly set in the compoent. 

The approach is that every month component will have a parent class depending the value from the state.

# Problem:

it is not worrking. :D

# Finding outs:

Although class are properly applied in the code (see first January 2017 and a Month, both have a class)

Nevertheless the decoration never occurs. its like the CSS class never was written... Can it be that a componenent is hidding the class. 

Test -> to write the CSS class in global namespace to see if is parsed.
