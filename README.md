## Github management. 
  
Intended for shared management. For repo proceed as usual. 
take in account that `shared` folder is attach to a shared remote repo. 

# Standart proceed to get shared updates from github repository

`$ git fetch shared`
`$ git merge -s subtree --squash \ shared/<branch>` where `<branch` is the given branch to update
usually `master`

# Updating the code:

Commits touching only the subtree, intended for backport (e.g. fixes); (below)

# Backporting to the subtreeâ€™s remote

- create a branch `$ git checkout -b backport-shared \ shared/master`
- cherry-pick the changes to commit to shared: `$ git cherry-pick -x <SHA1>`
- `$ git push`
- Return to the working branch (master)
- Remove unused branch used for porting back.
